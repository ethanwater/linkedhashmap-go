// Consistent hashing was designed to avoid the problem of having to reassign every BLOB when a server is added or
// removed throughout the cluster. The central idea is to use a hash function that maps both the BLOB and servers to a
// unit circle, usually 2Ï€ radians


//BLOB: a computer data storage approach that manages data as "blobs" or "objects", as opposed to other storage
//architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks
//within sectors and tracks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage)
